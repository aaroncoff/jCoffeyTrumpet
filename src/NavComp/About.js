                <p>
                    Almost Doctor Joshua Coffey has a Bachelor's degree in Music from Brigham Young University & a Masters<br/>
                    degree in Music from Arizona State University and is currently pursuing a DMA in Trumpet Performance &<br/>

                    dog, Mojo.  He knows more about music than you do & he can beat you up with jiu-jitsu if he doesn't like<br/>
                    you so be cool. Give him a call if you want him to learn you to toot a horn more good, or if you want him<br/>
                    to do a toot at your graduation, funeral, quincea√±era, wedding or divorce.  He charges extra for one-on-one<br/>
                    toots. Please make all payments in ones.
