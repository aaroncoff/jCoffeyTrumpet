                <p>
                    Almost Doctor Joshua Michael Coffey was born on a beautiful October day in 1987.  He is the second best<br/>
                    Scattergories player in his family and is totally bald.  Even though he is in his early thirties he never<br/>
                    got over the awkward band-nerd stage.  In high school his fellow band nerds worshipped him as a god. Josh<br/> 
                    has nearly 20 years of experience playing the trumpet.  He has a Bachelor's degree in Music from Brigham Young<br/> 
                    University and a Masters degree in Music from Arizona State University and is currently pursuing a DMA in <br/>
                    Trumpet Performance and Pedagogy from Arizona State.  Josh currently resides in his parent's basement in<br/>
                    Mesa, Arizona with his dog, Mojo.  He knows more about music than you do and he can beat you up with jiu-jitsu<br/>
                    if he doesn't like you so be cool.  Give him a call if you want to learn to toot a horn more good, or if you<br/>
                    want him to do a toot at your wedding, funeral, quincea√±era or divorce.  He charges extra for one-on-one toots.
